Developed an interactive Sales & Customer Funnel Report for a Shopify e-commerce platform using Power BI. The dashboard provides end-to-end visibility into business performance by tracking critical KPIs such as net sales, average order value, customer segmentation (single vs. repeat buyers), repeat rate, and lifetime value.

# Key visualizations include:

Sales Trends Over Time

Geographic Sales Distribution (Province & City Level)

Sales by Payment Gateway (Shopify, PayPal, Amazon, Gift Card)

Sales by Product Type

Customer Metrics: Purchase frequency, total customers, repeat rate

Dynamic Filters: Measure, Gateway, Province

This project empowered stakeholders to derive actionable insights, enhance customer retention strategies, and optimize regional and product-level sales performance.
